Cube volume program:
	To run this program simply enter a number (can  be an int or float) and press enter.
	Then enter y or n to enter another number or to exit the program.

	The unit tests I chose were testing a negative int to see if that would effect output.
	Then a negative float to see how that effects the output.
	Then a positve float to see if that effects the output.

List average program:
	To run this program enter the number of elements you would like to enter.
	Then when prompted, enter each element of the list.
	Then enter y or n to repeat the process or to quit.

	The unit tests I chose were a list with some positive ints.
	A list with all negative ints.
	A list with some negative ints.
	An empty list.
	A list with floats.
	And a list with some ints and some floats.

	There is a bug that I am not sure why it happens where it only takes the first 5 list element inputs, but if you try to enter more for a larger list it does not accept the input.
	For instance, you can enter 5 as list size and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the elements and the program will work as intended.
	But if you try 6 as the list size, it will accept 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but then when you enter 6, it will report an incorrect input.

Full name program:
	To run this program enter a first name, then a last name when prompted.
	Then enter y or n to repeat the process or to quit.

	The unit tests I chose were first and last name strings with letters and numbers
	A first and last name that are numbers.
	A first name that is a number and a last name that is a string.
